# Advent of Code

<br />1st day:
<br />Solved with Excel
<br />Copied data into Excel
<br />Added column#1 that numbered elves with =A2+1*(B3="")
<br />Added column#2 that added calories for each elf as long as it wasn't a blank row =(C1+B2)*(B2<>"")
<br />Added column#3 that pulled out total value for each elf =C2*(C3<C2)
<br />Copied values of column#1 and column#3 to new columns (so they can be sorted without affecting the formulas).  
<br />Viola!  Elves sorted by # calories.  
<br />2nd challenge was easy once I had that
