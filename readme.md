# Advent of Code

1st day:
Solved with Excel
Copied data into Excel
Added column#1 that numbered elves with =A2+1*(B3="")
Added column#2 that added calories for each elf as long as it wasn't a blank row =(C1+B2)*(B2<>"")
Added column#3 that pulled out total value for each elf =C2*(C3<C2)
Copied values of column#1 and column#3 to new columns (so they can be sorted without affecting the formulas).  Viola!  Elves sorted by # calories.  
2nd challenge was easy once I had that
